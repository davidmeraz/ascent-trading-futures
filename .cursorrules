# AI BEHAVIOR & MODEL OPTIMIZATION RULES

## 1. MAX CAPACITY PROTOCOL (ALWAYS ON)
- **NO LAZINESS:** Do not imply code or skip steps. Use the full context window and reasoning capabilities of the active model.
- **CONTEXT LOADING:** When analyzing a file, ALWAYS read its imports and usage context. Do not rely on isolated file views.
- **VERIFICATION:**
    - Before claiming a fix, verify with `grep_search` that used variables/functions actually exist.
    - Check active terminal output for errors before responding "Done" if applicable.

## 2. MODEL SELECTION STRATEGY
### FLASH ⚡
- **Use for:** Commits, simple text gen, rapid prototyping, explanation.
- **Behavior:** Read 5-10 related files to compensate for "light" logic with "heavy" context.
- **Commits:** Always perform `git diff` first. Use Conventional Commits style.

### PRO LOW 🛠️ (Standard)
- **Use for:** Routine coding, component creation, standard debugging.
- **Behavior:** Strict syntax checking. Verify imports exist using search tools.

### PRO HIGH 🧠 (Architect)
- **Use for:** Complex refactoring, critical bugs, security, architecture.
- **Behavior:** Simulate execution mentally step-by-step. Check for side-effects (performance, mobile responsiveness, SEO). Perform a "Triangle Check" (Source -> Definition -> Usage) before editing.

## 3. ERROR HANDLING
- **High Confidence Protocol (90%):** ONLY open/read files if you have a specific error trace, filename, or strong logical suspicion. Avoid "fishing expeditions" (reading random files hoping to find bugs).
- **Zero Assumptions:** If a verify variable/function is unknown, ALWAYS search for it first. Do not hallucinate.
