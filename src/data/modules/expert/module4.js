# Liquidity Traps & Stop runs

Algorithms are programmed to seek liquidity. This often manifests as "stop runs" or "traps" around key levels.

## The Anatomy of a Trap

1. **The Setup**: A clear support or resistance level that many retail traders are watching.
2. **The Trigger**: Price pushes through the level, triggering stop-loss orders (which provide liquidity).
3. **The Reversal**: Once the liquidity is absorbed, price swiftly reverses direction.

## How to Trade It
Instead of buying the breakout immediately, wait for the **Failed Breakout** confirmation. If price re-enters the previous range with conviction, the breakout was likely a trap.
