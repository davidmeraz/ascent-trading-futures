# Auction Market Theory

Welcome to the Expert level. In this module, we move beyond simple patterns and indicators to understand the **why** behind price movement.

## The Market as an Auction

Every financial market is simply a dual-auction process designed to facilitate trade.
- **Buyers** want the lowest price.
- **Sellers** want the highest price.
- **Fair Value** is where they agree to do business.

When price moves away from value, it is seeking new participants. This search for liquidity is the core driver of all trends.
