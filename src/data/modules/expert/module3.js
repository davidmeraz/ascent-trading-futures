# Composite Volume Profiles

Instead of just looking at the daily profile, we construct profiles over weeks, months, or entire contract periods.

## High Volume Nodes (HVN)
Areas where significant trade has occurred. Price accepts these levels and often rotates here. They act as magnets.

## Low Volume Nodes (LVN)
Areas where price spent little time. Often indicates swift rejection or a breakout. Price moves through these zones quickly.
